# ISS Tracker

## Information

This is a project built with ReactJS and its purpose is to provide tracking information of the International Space Station.

I am connected to the "Open Notify API" from which I will be grabbing the information showing the location, pass times and how many people currently are in the ISS.

## Running

To run the project, first run `npm install` to install all packages and then run `npm start` to view the project in the browser.
